"""
External attention, based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be 
implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two normalization layers; 
it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing popular architectures. External attention 
has linear complexity and implicitly considers the correlations between all data samples.
